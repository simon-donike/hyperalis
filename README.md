# Hyperalis Labs  
Accelerating Applied AI for Earth Observation  
https://hyperalis.com

## Executive Summary
Hyperalis Labs enables organizations to adopt cutting-edge AI for Earth observation without requiring internal research teams. Our mission is to translate the latest scientific advances into robust, operational solutions and help companies integrate modern models, workflows and data products directly into their business processes.

## Background and Motivation
AI-driven Earth observation is advancing quickly, but most organizations do not have the in-house expertise needed to keep pace with current research. Deploying high-performance models, curated workflows and scalable data pipelines requires deep experience in remote sensing, computer vision and open-source ecosystem development. Hyperalis was founded by applied scientists with extensive experience delivering production-grade solutions, large research efforts and open-source tools used by international institutions.

Hyperalis also maintains dedicated computational infrastructure that allows us to run model training and fine-tuning workflows directly for clients. This includes GPU-accelerated systems suitable for large-scale experiments, rapid prototyping and domain-specific model adaptation.

## Value Proposition
Hyperalis provides direct access to expert-level EO AI capabilities, allowing clients to:

- Integrate advanced computer vision and AI analysis on multispectral, SAR and hyperspectral data.
- Deploy and customize state-of-the-art models for super-resolution, segmentation, detection, change analysis and domain adaptation.
- Build reproducible and scalable workflows that follow modern open-source best practices.
- Fine-tune and extend AI systems using client-specific data to maximize operational accuracy, supported by our in-house compute environment.
- Translate research outcomes into commercial-grade data products and decision-support tools.
